**Note** : The paper hasn't been published yet. Full code will be updated after publication of paper.

This project was undertaken as the minor project during the sixth semester of our undergraduate study.
It addresses the crucial objective of achieving precise matching between contactless 2D fingerprint images and their contact-based counterparts to enhance the effectiveness of emerging contactless fingerprint technologies.

## Problem Statement
- The existing limitations in accurately matching contactless and contact-based fingerprints pose a significant hurdle in leveraging the advancements of contactless 2D/3Dfingerprint identification systems.
- The lack of a robust and reliable framework capable of accurately comparing and aligning contactless 2D fingerprints with their contact-based counterparts hinders the widespread adoption and efficacy of modern biometric technologies.
- Existing methodologies fail to address the disparities in fingerprint representations
captured by distinct sensor technologies, resulting in a significant decline in matching
accuracy and reliability.

## Dataset
- The dataset was obtained from the University at Buffalo- Center for Unified Biometrics and Sensors. The data consisted of two types of fingerprint images, namely, contact-based and contactless. The number of contact-based images was 920, and contactless images were 11,252.
